Quick intro to Testling CI (Cross Browser Testing)

If you've never heard of testling (or been *too busy* to try it out)
in the next 10 minutes you will learn everything you need to get started.

### What is Testling?

[Tesling][] is an automated browser testing tool (brother of [Browserling][])
that lets you "***run your browser tests on every push***".

Testling will not *magically* make your app work in all browsers. :tired_face:
You will still need to write (unit) tests, Testling will run them for you
in any browser you specify in your config. 

### Get Started

Since there's no registration required for open-source projects,
you can just dive in by following: https://ci.testling.com/guide/quick_start
